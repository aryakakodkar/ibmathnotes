This repository contains my written up math notes for 
the IB Math syllabus.

The LaTeX template employed for these notes was written by Github user sleepymalc, and can be found at [this link](https://github.com/sleepymalc/LaTeX-Template/tree/main).

I am certain that you will find some errata within these notes, and I will be grateful if these are pointed out.

I am aware that exercise sections are incomplete. I aim to remedy that over time, but my priority is to cover the fundamental concepts. An excellent source for exercises is the [textbook by Wathall and co.](https://global.oup.com/education/product/oxford-ib-diploma-programme-oxford-ib-diploma-programme-ib-mathematics-analysis-and-approaches-higher-level-enhanced-online-course-book-9780198427186/?region=uk).
